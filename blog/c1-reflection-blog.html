        <p>I am excited to experience EDA. I believe it is going to challenge me to learn in a way that I haven't experienced before. Both in the content and the style, particularly the bootcamp and its immersive nature.<br><br> A thought which resonated with me was 'exposing ignorance', and our inability to properly learn if we don't truely expose our ignorance. This aspect of EDA makes me excited to learn in an environment where any question is valid and any skill level valued. I also liked the idea that the hardest part about programming isn't dealing with your computer, but with other humans, as coding is a collaborative process, more so than I first realised.<br><br> I am unsure yet how i will deal with the culture of EDA, but from responses from friends and peers who have graduated I believe I will find the culture to be welcoming and supportive! I believe the supportive nature of EDA will help me through the workload, something I am nervous about, particularly as we move towards the bootcamp.
