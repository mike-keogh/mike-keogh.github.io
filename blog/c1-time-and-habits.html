    <h3>Time and Habit Reflections</h3>
      <p>I used the pomodoro technique. In previous studies I had used the pomodoro technique but did not realise that was what it was called. I have begun to try and implement certain habits I read about by implementing them in small steps. Habits I am trying to instill are using time efficiently, working on assignments from the ground up and being communicative with my cohort. I have also tried to use some meditative techniques relating to breathing, particularly when I am stuck on a problem. I enjoyed reading the article on counter intuitive methods to increase production. I feel like a lot of my habits I will need to develop, will revolve around breaking old study habits and ideas which aren't healthy or productive.<br><br> I like using the pomodoro method, as I feel it keeps you fresh and interested in the work you are doing. I think using breathing as a meditative tool, is important when a problem begins to overtake your ability to think clearly. I also hope that I will be able to develop my habits gradually by starting small. I want to try and incorporate the counter intuitive methods for productivity as a part of developing my habits.
