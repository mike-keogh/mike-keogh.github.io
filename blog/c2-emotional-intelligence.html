              I took from the chapter, 'What Emotional Intelligence Is and How To Develop It', that the traditional notion of intelligence and how we perceive intelligence is skewed.<br> The ability to work as a team and to able to read the signs our peers give off is far more valuable to an organisation than one brain with all the brawn.<br>I liked the part about our brains manifesting and intensifying our emotions, and that listening to our bodies is a more sound idea. <br>
              From my two minutes of mindfulness, I forgot about the stresses of study and work and found time to relax while focusing on something simple like my breathing.
