            The process over product concept made it very hard for me to build my site!
            There is still much I want to complete but could not if I wanted to stick
            to the concept. It is good to let go though, and appreciate the point of
            the exercise. I am aware that I can be a perfectionist so it is good
            to take a step back and focus on the process.
            <br><br>
            Before I read chapter two, I had sometimes tried meditation, and knew
            little about its history and real purpose. I have learnt that meditation
            is exercise for the mind. Given that meditation is all about attention,
            it makes sense that it is used to train the brain into attention.
            <br><br>
            I think that mindfulness meditation is something I will try and implement
            into my routine. Having felt the stress associated with programming it
            would be nice to practise new techniques for dealing with stress, and also
            for keeping concentration for longer.
