            <p>
              The main thing I learned from my mindfulness conversation is how often
              i dip into my own thoughts during conversation. I needed to really focus
              to be able to take on board what my partner was saying. It helped to say back
              what she was saying as it meant that I was solidfying what she had said and that
              i was actually taking on what was being said. It was also hard to not interupt
              and want to add things to the conversation when it was not my time to speak.
              <br><br>
              I would like to try and implement the walking mindfulness technique as I walk
              quite a lot and already enjoy walking for its mind clearing properties. Before I would walk without headphones in order to clear my mind but I was never mindful of my actions. It will be interesting now to try and walk while practising mindfulness! I also liked the analogy of a being starting to walk
              and starting to meditate. It seems a very daunting task, much like programming,
              to begin with but over time and practise will become second nature.
              <br><br>
              I found it interesting to think of the many times when mindfulness would have been an important tool in my life but I never thought it could apply to me. It seems that mindfulness and meditation have a lot more to offer me than I could have known. It would be interesting to see it become more commonplace and not limited to a sort of specialised training.
