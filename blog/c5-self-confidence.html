                Mindfulness is self-awareness in practise and vice versa. We can think of
                the two as being virtually similar in their outcomes. Both want to achieve
                the goal of awareness of ourselves and in our surroundings.
                <br><br>
                I tried body scanning. It was a very interesting experience considering how
                easy it is to neglect what our bodies are doing when we aren't conscious
                of it. I found it to be hard to concentrate on certain areas of my body.
                It was harder when I did not have any sensations to base my focus off of,
                but was a good exercise to practise mindfulness.

                The emotions are not me section is for me one of the more important sections
                I have read so far from Search Inside Yourself. I think it is important to
                realise that we are experiencing our emotions and not embodying them. Realising
                our emotions in this way leaves room for more rational thought when we may
                feel that our emotions are taking over our ability to think and act clearly. It
                will be something which I will try to remember during times of frustration
                during both this course and outside of it.
