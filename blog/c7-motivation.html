                  Life through a pleasure, passion and purpose lense, seems all too
                  familiar! It is easy to see in my life where each step is incorporated
                  and with which activities or interests fall into which pursuit of happiness.
                  Through reflection and experience it is easy to see how the pursuit of
                  happiness through material or external rewards is unattainable all of the
                  time especially if it is the only method of happiness you are attmepting to
                  achieve. It is always nice to work towards a goal which is bigger than
                  yourself and is something I have not really been fully involved in, so hopefully I will be able to put the skills learned in EDA towards something bigger than 'me'. I enjoy the flow also, it is something I do everytime I work as a barista or am playing music I enjoy. The autonomous parts of what I have learned and muscle memory take over and you find yourself performing tasks or playing songs
                  without even thinking about it. I enjoy learning new skills and being able to be in the flow with them.
                  <br><br>
                  I believe that some of my core values, those which I try to live my life by,
                  are to treat everyone equally and without assumption, to be fair, and to have
                  fun. I want to try and see the best in people and try to be the best person I can be, which can be hard! I stand for the fair and equal treatment of all people
                  on earth. I stand by compassion and empathy as being important for growth and understanding.
                  <br><br>
                  The resilience and meditation exercise was interesting to feel the emotional and
                  physiological response to both failure and success. It is interesting to think that failure is an important step in our growth as people and in our pursuits but that we seem to not embrace failure very well. When I think about my life, I can recognise many failures, but also much success. These ideas also tie into resilience and how that can shape our failures and successes. This exercise made me think more positively about my failures and also how our failures can shape us.
