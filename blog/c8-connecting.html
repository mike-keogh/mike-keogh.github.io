                <h5>Trust and Sincerity</h5>
                <p>
                  I haven't had an opportunity yet to try the exercise since reading this chapter,
                  but I have reflected on the points made. It is important to remove judgement or bias
                  from someone before we have been proven otherwise. This exercise is good for treating everybody we meet as good, it makes us less judgemental and would most likely give us the opportunity to see aspects of people we wouldn't have previously allowed ourselves too.

                </p>

                <h5>Empathetic Listening</h5>
                <p>
                  This was a good exercise to do with my girlfriend. This was good for us as we had our normal conversations in a way but with more emphasis on how we felt. I imagine this task would be a lot tougher with someone whom I did not already know very well but it would most likely enhance the power of empathetic listening when done with someone you don't know very well.
                </p>

                <h5>Loving/Kindness Meditation</h5>
                <p>
                  I found this exercise to have the biggest effect on me of this weeks tasks. This really made me understand how empathy is a crucial trait for humankind. It makes us forget any grudges or misgivings we may have about someone when we remind ourselves they feel the same things we believe may be exclusive to ourselves.
                </p>

                <h5>Political Empathy</h5>
                <p>
                  In this situation I had found out that my flatmate had borrowed my car
                  and whilst it was parked someone had dinged the front bumper. He had borrowed the car
                  to pick up somebody from the airport. The conflict arose because they did not
                  tell me until I mentioned the bump in the car.
                  <br><br>
                  In my mind, I felt that they had been dishonest in not telling me that there
                  had been an accident. I did not know really why they did not tell me that this had happened, as I have insurance and it would have been easy enough to sort out. Accidents
                  happen. From their perspective I imagine they thought they didn't need to tell me because
                  it wasn't a big dent and they hadn't caused the accident. I believe that is why they did not tell me about it.
