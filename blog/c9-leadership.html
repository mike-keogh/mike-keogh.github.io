      <h3>Leadership</h3>

                <h5>Compassionate Leadership</h5>
                <p>
                  The three steps towards compassionate leadership are interesting to think about in relation to my own experience both in being a leader and being in a team with a leader. I have minimal experience being a leader but I took on a role as the manager of the cafe I used to work for. I did not explicitly know what compassionate leadership was, or the three tenets of it, but I would not have been proud of myself had I not behaved similarly to what they teach. As a team member, having a leader who is compassionate makes being a part of the team so much easier. I can think of a few jobs where the leader had very little compassion for his team. As a result there was little respect or admiration shown on either side.

                <h5>Goodness</h5>
                <p>
                  Similar to the trust and sincerity exercise, this exercise helped to show that we are all human. It can be easy to judge people straight off the bat if we have perceived that we have been wronged but this exercise shows that it is good for us to cast aside judgement in those situations.
                </p>

                <h5>Tonglen</h5>
                <p>
                  This was a hard exercise. It was difficult in the first attempt to control my thoughts during this exercise. It can be hard to ourselves as people that suffer but it is good to try and visualise that suffering leave us.
                </p>

                <h5>SCARF</h5>
                  <p>
                    I related to every point made in relation to my experience so far and will continue to relate to them during bootcamp no doubt. Each letter of the acronym had some relevancy to my life already or some part of learning something new. Especially Status, Autonomy and Relatedness. I find comfort knowing that my insecurities are actually very general and expected.

                  </p>

                <h5>Difficult Conversation</h5>
                  <p>
                    This went ok, and I definitely made the conversation out to be harder than it actually had to be. Bringing things out in the open is good for both parties. I definitely need more practise having difficult conversations! It will be an important skill to learn.
