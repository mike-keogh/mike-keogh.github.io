            <h5>Grid Based Designs</h5>
            <p>Grid based designs are a way of thinking about designing and laying out webpages. You can divide a page into 12 equal parts which gives you the ability to have different options when designing web pages.

              <h5>Responsive Web Design</h5>
              <p>Responsive web pages have the hype because you can design web pages to be used on any device! The browser recognises what type of device you are using, and displays the content according to the developers specifications. This allows for one site which can be viewed across different platforms and screen sizes.

            <h5>Semantic Structure</h5>
            <p>Semantic structure refers to the types of tags used in web design and their purpose. If a tag translates meaning to the user then it is semantic. For instance a p tag denotes that a paragraph will be inside, so it is a semantic tag. A div tag does not have any semantic meaning because there could be anything inside of it.

            <h5>Additional Learning</h5>
          <p>Other points I learned from the videos were how to break down a mock up into grids, and to start with the biggest elements first and also to be descriptive with class names.
