            <p>
              Compared to HTML and CSS, which are both rule based languages, Javascript
              runs on logic. Through javascript, a developer can create websites
              which are interactive and dynamic. It has the ability to run loops,
              store and access data, and complete amongst other notable things,
              mathematic functions.
              <br><br>
              Control flow, is the order in which the computer will execute statements,
              particularly in loops, if/else statements and switch statements. An analogy for this flow may be akin to how
              we decide whether to do certain activities: If the weather is nice,
              we may go to the beach, else we will stay inside and watch a movie etc.
              Or we can think of reading a menu as similar to a switch statement (albeit a very simple one), we stop viewing the menu once we have decided what we are having.
              <br><br>
              Accessing data from arrays, requires the understanding that arrays are zero
              index based. This means data stored in an array, will always begin at zero.
              Arrays have a key, value sotrage system. Data in objects will have a key, and a value. It is common to access data in an object through its key/property value. We would also access the object through either dot or bracket notation. Arrays can only be viewed through bracket[] notation.
              <br><br>
              A function is block of code, written to perform a certain task. So far we have focused on functions which perform mathematical tasks, such as transferring celcius to farenheit but they can have many different functions. Functions are useful as we can use them many times without having to rewrite our code, all we need to do is call the function.
