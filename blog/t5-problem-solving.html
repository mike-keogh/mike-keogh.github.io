              <p>
                A problem I was recently stuck on, was attempting to create an array
                in javascript and then loop through that array with a for loop and
                output the result to a function. The main problem solving techniques
                I used to solve this problem were google, my peers and the course
                resources. I also used a bit of pseudocode. This problem was synonymous
                with a number of problems I have encountered at my time in EDA so far.
                My problem involved me not reading my code properly and not being critical
                of what some of my code was supposed to be doing. I figured out my problem through
                pseudocoding and the help of my peers which heloed me to go back through
                my code and see where the problem was. During this problem I felt stress,
                uncertainty and a little bit of helplessness as I believed my code was correct.
                <br><br>
                I learned in these situations it is important to be extra critical of what your
                code says. Especially where an example is shown. I need to be careful of the code
                presented in the examples so that I see each line of code clearly and in context.
                <br><br>
                I don't know how elegant my solution to problem has been but I was
                working on the FizzBuzz problem and I felt the most elegant thing about
                my approach to that problem was properly attempting to pseudocode the
                problem before I began writing code. This I think will be an important method
                in the future when confronted with problems. The problem was to get the program to
                print both "Fizz", "Buzz" and "FizzBuzz". In my solution I learned that the order of
                statements in an if/else statement is important. I found that I had not written
                my statements correctly. Using google helped me to solve this problem and I learned
                about the language to use when searching a problem. I feel when you can describe a
                problem effectively it can be a lot easier to diagnose.
                <br><br>
                I feel I am confident using google, reading error messages, asking my peers or coaches and rubby ducky methods to solve problems. These are probably my highest used problem solving
                techniques. I need to work more on using pseudocoding as a way to solve problems.
                I have begun to implement it a lot more now that we are using javascript to solve
                problems. As we learn more I think I will develop more skills to 'try something'.
                At the moment I feel that I don't have a strong enough command over javascript to
                just try something at the moment. I also need to work on using console.log to
                problem solve. I am very fond of using reflection in my learning process. When I am faced with a problem that is taking me a  while to figure out, I enjoy taking a walk
                or disengaging my self from the problem physically and trying to reflect on the
                problem. Sometimes you are able to see the problem in a new light or realise something
                that had not occurred to you previously. It also helps to remove yourself from
                your terminal to be able to keep fresh.

                <h3>.map()</h3>

                 <p>
                   The map method will calculate a designated function, and output the result to each
                   element, in a new array. The original array will remain unaltered, and we will have a
                   new array with the new output. Say an array contained the numbers one to 10, and we
                   wanted a new array to contain the numbers one to 10 but times by two. Using map, our array
                   would have a new output with the original arrays values times by two and also our original
                   array would stand unaltered.
                 </p>

               <h3>.filter()</h3>

                 <p>The filter method will create a new array with the values which passed through,
                   given the parameters of the filter. If we continue with our array containing the numbers
                   one through to 10, but want to filter all the even numbers out, our new array will contain
                   only odd numbers, and our original array will remain as is.

                 </p>

                 <h3>.reduce()</h3>
                 <p>
                   The reduce method reduces an array to single value. For example, our array with numbers
                   one through to 10, if used with reduce will output 55.
                 </p>
